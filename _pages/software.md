Code Nerd
------

If you're ever running into problems related to quantitative data analysis, I created [Code Nerd](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-J5futwiVV-code-nerd) -- a GPT-4-based tool dedicated to resolving programming queries in data wrangling and analysis. No chatter, just code ðŸ˜Ž Its default is R, but it can also tackle questions on Python, Stata, or any other language.

Access requires an OpenAI account and a ChatGPT Plus subscription.

Code Nerd was featured on [InfoWorld](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3848270/genai-tools-for-r-new-tools-to-make-r-programming-easier.html).
