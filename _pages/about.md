I am a migration and political communication scholar at [Tel Aviv University](https://en-social-sciences.tau.ac.il/soc-ant) and [Goethe University Frankfurt](http://www.fb03.uni-frankfurt.de/70378950). Currently, I'm a [fellow](https://www.academy.ac.il/RichText/GeneralPage.aspx?nodeId=1620) at the *Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities*.

My research focuses on attitudes, migration, and political communication employing quantitative and computational methods as well as natural language processing. The results were published in esteemed general social science journals like *[Social Forces](research/czymara_2021_sf)*, *European Sociological Review* ([1](research/czymara_schmidt-catran_2017_esr) and [2](research/czymara_dochow_2018_esr)), *[European Journal of Political Research](research/naegel_etal_2023_ejpr)*, and top-tier specialty outlets such as *Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies* ([1](research/czymara_etal_2023_jems) and [2](research/schmidt-catran_czymara_2023_jems)), *[International Migration Review](research/czymara_2020_imr)*, and *[Mass Communication and Society](research/czymara_2024_mcas)*. My work ranks in the [top 25% most cited documents worldwide](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57190279510#tab=metrics), earning the [Janet A. Harkness Award](https://wapor.org/events/annual-conference/awards-funds/janet-a-harkness-student-paper-award/) of the *World Association for Public Opinion Research* and the *American Association for Public Opinion Research* and the German [Preis der Fritz Thyssen Stiftung für sozialwissenschaftliche Aufsätze](https://www.fritz-thyssen-stiftung.de/cms/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Jahresbericht_2017_interaktiv.pdf). Moreover, national and international media have featured these findings, influencing policy institutions including the [World Bank](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/61074efa-6086-5048-bb91-96f4f6353f92), the [European Parliament](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/a1016d77-2562-11eb-9d7e-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-174747154) and the [International Labour Organization](https://www.ilo.org/ilc/ILCSessions/109/reports/reports-to-the-conference/WCMS_792123/lang--en/index.htm).  For my information on my research see [here](research), my CV is available [here](cv).
