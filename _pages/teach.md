Open Access Materials
======

Introduction to R
------

If you're interested in mastering the fundamentals of R, I've created an hands-on Colab designed to facilitate an intuitive understanding of R's core logic and essential functions. This exercise offers a practical approach to learning, allowing you to apply concepts as you go. To get started and explore these foundational aspects of R programming, access the exercise [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/czymara/czymara.github.io/blob/master/_teaching/Intro_to_R.ipynb).

Introduction to Topic Modelling
------

My course [Introduction to Topic Modelling in R and Python](https://sites.google.com/view/dariia-mykhailyshyna/main/r-workshops-for-ukraine#h.k2gh03lf4lre), offered as part of the [Workshops for Ukraine](https://sites.google.com/view/dariia-mykhailyshyna/main/r-workshops-for-ukraine) series, is now openly accessible. For a hands-on experience, you are invited to explore the course materials through interactive Colab notebooks: the [first Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/czymara/czymara.github.io/blob/master/_teaching/topic_models_Ukraine_23_R.ipynb) focuses on R implementations, the [second Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/czymara/czymara.github.io/blob/master/_teaching/topic_models_Ukraine_23_BERTopic.ipynb) delves into Python applications. These resources are designed to enhance your learning and application of various topic modeling techniques in both languages.


Experience
======

I started teaching during my PhD in the summer term of 2016, initially serving as a tutor for econometric exercise sessions at the University of Cologne. My teaching role expanded in 2018, when I took a full-time position at Goethe University Frankfurt. There, I specialized in teaching advanced quantitative methods to social science students.

Beyond semester-long courses, I have also taught in various summer schools, focusing on text analysis, panel data analysis, and multilevel modeling. I am experienced in teaching in both English and German, across a range of formats including online and in-person, and at levels from Bachelor's to PhD. The student evaluations showcased on this page reflect the consistent positive reception of my courses.

In addition, I have supervised numerous Bachelor's and Master's theses, providing comprehensive academic guidance and support.
