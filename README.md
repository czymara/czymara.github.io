All my publications and their appendices are available in the [files](https://github.com/czymara/czymara.github.io/tree/master/files) folder.

Two more piece of code uploaded here:

- [Citations](https://github.com/czymara/czymara.github.io/tree/master/code/teachingevaluations) plots the citations of my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=khPqHmgAAAAJ&hl=en) using the API provided by the `scholar` package.
- [Teachingevaluations](https://github.com/czymara/czymara.github.io/tree/master/code/teachingevaluations) generates two plots: First, The time trend of students' quantitative evaluations of my courses. Second, a wordcloud of the qualitative evaluations (although I do not upload the raw data due to potential privacy issues).
