I am a social scientist and lecturer at the [department of Sociology with Focus on Quantitative Methods for Social Research, Goethe University Frankfurt](http://www.fb03.uni-frankfurt.de/70378950). My research focuses on immigration, ethnic conflicts, political communication and public opinion. To test my ideas against the real world, I often draw upon longitudinal and multi-national demographic and survey data, as well as quantitative text analysis and computational social science tools. My work has been published in top general journals like *European Sociological Review* and *Social Forces*, as well as in specialized journals such as *Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies*, *International Migration Review*, and *Ethnic and Racial Studies*.

In addition to researching, I [teach](teach) courses on quantitative methods and conducting analytical-empirical studies for students of the social sciences (English and German, online and offline) and supervise BA and MA theses.
