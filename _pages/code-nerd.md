If you're ever running into problems related to quantitative data analysis, I created [Code Nerd](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-J5futwiVV-code-nerd) -- a GPT-4-based tool dedicated to resolving programming queries in data wrangling and analysis. No chatter, just code ðŸ˜Ž Its default is R, but of course it can also tackle questions on Python, Stata, or any other language.

Access requires an OpenAI account and a ChatGPT Plus subscription.
