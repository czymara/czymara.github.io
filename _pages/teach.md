I specialize in teaching courses focused on quantitative methods and research design. My teaching portfolio spans several years and includes experience at multiple institutions and in diverse educational formats. Below, I have provided a curated list of courses, accompanied by a brief overview of my teaching experience.

Open-access Courses
======

Introduction to R
------

If you're interested in mastering the fundamentals of R, I've created an hands-on Colab designed to facilitate an intuitive understanding of R's core logic and essential functions. This exercise offers a practical approach to learning, allowing you to apply concepts as you go. To get started and explore these foundational aspects of R programming, access the exercise [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/czymara/czymara.github.io/blob/master/_teaching/Intro_to_R.ipynb).

Topic Modelling
------

My workshop [Topic Modelling in R and Python](https://sites.google.com/view/dariia-mykhailyshyna/main/r-workshops-for-ukraine#h.k2gh03lf4lre), offered as part of the [Workshops for Ukraine](https://sites.google.com/view/dariia-mykhailyshyna/main/r-workshops-for-ukraine) series, is now openly accessible. The slides of this workshop are available [here](https://czymara.com/teaching/topic_models_Ukraine_23.html). For a hands-on experience, you are invited to explore the course materials through interactive Colab notebooks: the first Colab focuses on [R implementations](https://colab.research.google.com/github/czymara/czymara.github.io/blob/master/_teaching/topic_models_Ukraine_23_R.ipynb), the second Colab delves into [Python applications](https://colab.research.google.com/github/czymara/czymara.github.io/blob/master/_teaching/topic_models_Ukraine_23_BERTopic.ipynb). These resources are designed to enhance your learning and application of various topic modeling techniques in both languages, using real world newspaper texts as examples.

Multilevel Modelling
------

My comprehensive research training [Vergleichende Sozialforschung mit Mehrebenenmodellen in R](https://github.com/czymara/CompSocResearchWS21) is available in open access (while title and course description are in German, all materials are in English). The aim of the course is to equip students with the skills to conduct their own comparative studies in R. The curriculum is structured around data from my favorite large-scale survey program, the [European Social Survey](https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/). This data provides students with real-world insights and a practical understanding of multilevel modeling. Consisting of 15 sessions, this training was originally conducted at Goethe University Frankfurt during the winter term of 2021/22. Most sessions include a 90-minute lecture followed by a 90-minute exercise, ensuring a balanced blend of theoretical knowledge and practical application. The course's in-depth content and hands-on approach make it an ideal resource for researchers delving into comparative social research and multilevel modeling using R.

Experience
======

I started teaching during my PhD in the summer term of 2016, initially serving as a tutor for econometric exercise sessions at the University of Cologne. My teaching role expanded in 2018, when I took a full-time position at Goethe University Frankfurt. There, I specialized in teaching advanced quantitative methods to social science students.

Beyond semester-long courses, I have also taught in various summer schools, focusing on text analysis, panel data analysis, and multilevel modeling. I am experienced in teaching in both English and German, across a range of formats including online and in-person, and at levels from Bachelor's to PhD. The student evaluations showcased on this page reflect the consistent positive reception of my courses.

In addition, I have supervised numerous Bachelor's and Master's theses, providing comprehensive academic guidance and support.
