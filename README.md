All my publications and their appendices are available in the [files](files) folder.

Two more pieces of code uploaded here:

- [Citations](code/citations/citations_plot.R) plots the citations of my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=khPqHmgAAAAJ&hl=en) using the API provided by the `scholar` package.
- [Teachingevaluations](code/teachingevaluations) generates two plots: First, The time trend of students' [quantitative evaluations](code/teachingevaluations/EvalOverTime.R) of my courses. Second, a wordcloud (and some other stuff) of the [qualitative evaluations](code/teachingevaluations/evalationwordclouds.R) (although I do not upload the raw data due to potential privacy issues).
